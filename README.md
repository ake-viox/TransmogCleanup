# TransmogCleanup

A World of Warcraft addon that sells transmog items from old raids in bulk.
This seems no longer maintained on Curse so I am making it work for myself.

## Installation

1. **Download** or clone this repository to your computer.
2. Rename the folder to `TransmogCleanup` if it isn’t already.
3. Place it in your WoW AddOns directory:
   ```
   \World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
   ```
4. **Restart WoW** or type `/reload` in chat if you’re already in-game.
5. Ensure the addon **TransmogCleanup** is enabled in the WoW AddOns list before logging in.

## Note

This addon will not be maintained, it is for my personal use.
